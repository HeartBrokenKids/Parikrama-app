// Fetch user's current city (Assuming you have a method to get the city)
        String userCity = getUserCity();

        // Call news API with user's city
        // Example: NewsAPI - Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key
        String apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
        String newsUrl = "https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?q=" + userCity + "&apiKey=" + apiKey;

        // Now, make a network request to fetch news using Retrofit, Volley, or OkHttp
        // Parse the response and update UI with top news headlines

        // Example: Set a dummy text to TextView for demonstration
        TextView textView = rootView.findViewById(R.id.news_text_view);
        textView.setText("Top News in " + userCity);
